    <p>Many ancient texts have creation stories as to how the universe, the Earth, the Solar System and us humans were created. Scientists have their own creation story and they call it the Big Bang.</p>
    <p>Back in the Medieval days, before the 20th century, it was believed that the universe was static, and that there was one galaxy in the universe, the Milky Way. The reason why people thought this was the case, because there were no observations made that proved this idea to be wrong. Moreover, this notion that the universe was static came from the law of physics at that time. However, in 1915, Einstein made a "mistake".</p>
    <p>While Einstein was contemplating his equations in his General Theory of Relativity, he realised that when matter was present is the fabric of space and time, the universe was not static. It was either expanding or contracting. Now Einstein did not know why this "error" popped up and decided to add a cosmological constant to cancel out all the terms and leave with the intended result, a static universe.</p>
    <p>It was really all down to three physicists, Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and Alexander Freideman, who we thank for the idea of a non-static expanding universe. Vesto Slipher began observing galaxies and their recessional velocity, in other words, how fast they appeared to be moving away. In 1922, Edwin Hubble calculated the distances between these galaxies and when both these measurements were put together on a map, they a proportionality between the two measurements and determined that the universe was expanding. From this, Alexander Friedemann realised that Einstein's equations were correct without the cosmological constant, and that indeed Einstein's theories were predicting the behaviour of our expanding universe. Soon, physicists realised that if the universe is expanding, then at some point in the past, the universe must have been smaller, until the universe was a single point. John Archibald Wheeler called this the Big Bang and the name stuck ever since.</p>
    <p>Well, what is the Big Bang?</p>
    <p>The Big Bang is a theory that aims to explain the expansion of the early universe. It states that at the very beginning, around 13.8 billion years ago, all matter was compressed into a infinitely small point called the Big Bang Singularity. (Note! - Singularities include both physical entities and a malfunction in the mathematical frameworks that govern the universe.). Then some phenomena occurred that lead to the expansion of space and time. During the first few instants after the big bang, there was just a hot, chaotic plasma that permeated the universe. There were no protons or neutrons, just fundamental particles including photons, quarks and electrons, all of which propogated at the speed of light. Back during those instants after the Big Bang, there was no Higgs Field which meant that no particles had mass. Eventually, over time as the universe cooled and expanded, the quarks began to forms protons and neutrons and even mesons, which were very unstable. All the four fundamental forces of nature (strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force and gravity) were all created and from this point on, our laws on the theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics and can explain the evolution of the universe.</p>
    <p>When the universe was still in its plasma stage, weird phenomena called baryonic acoustic oscillations occured that changed the structure of the plasma. This ultimately changed the structures of galaxy superclusters and galaxy clusters. During this plasma stage, the universe was an opaque, orange colour, which meant that it was very difficult for photons to get from one of the universe to the other. Around 380,000 years after the Big Bang, atoms formed, and the universe finally became transparent. When astronomers talk about the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), they are talking about the light we are observing from 380,000 years after the Big Bang. From that time to around 500 million years, the universe contained only gas. Eventually, 500 million years after the Big Bang, the first stars formed and the rest is history.</p>
    <p>However, the Big Bang Theory has a few problems. The first problem is that the observable universe, the section of the universe we can observe is 90 billion light-years across, not 27.6 billion light-years across like most might expect. And that's just the observable section of the universe. We have no idea as to how big the entire universe is. The second problem is that the CMB is very smooth and the plasma, which remember is very chaotic, would never have had enough time to smooth out. So, how did the plasma get all smooth?</p>
    <p>There is a popular contender that is able to describe the solution to both these problems. Inflation is the idea that during the first few instants after the Big Bang, the plasma would have got enough time to smooth out. After that there would be a period of an immense, accelerated expansion of the universe, so fast, that the expansion rate is faster than the speed of light. This would be able to explain the smoothness of the CMB but also be able to explain the gigantic size of the universe.</p>
    <p>A frequently asked question on inflation is, how can the universe be expanding faster than the speed of light if Einstein stated that the speed of light is the ultimate speed limit?</p>
    <p>Well, Einstein's Theories of General and Special Relativity do state that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, but this is only stating the speed limit of objects moving through space. In the case of inflation, the galaxies are not moving away faster than the speed of light, but rather space itself is expanding faster than the speed of light. Einstein's theories do not have a speed limit for the expansion of space itself.</p>
    <p>Another frequently asked question is how can space itself be expanding? Well you can think of the expansion of space as the expansion of raisin bread in an oven. Over time, the raisins in the bread will be farther apart than before, but that is not because the raisins are moving through the bread. It's because the bread itself is expanding, increasing the distance between the raisins in the bread.</p>
