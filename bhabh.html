    <p>Black Holes date back to over hundreds of years ago, before Einstein. The first thoughts of black holes were by physicists in the 18th Century who were pondering to te mathematical frameworks Newton had theorised. Black Holes were called dead stars back in those days and the physicists of that time predicted singularities that popped up in Newton's law of Gravitation. They theorised that if one objected was overlapping another, in other words, they was zero distance between both objects, then according to the law, a singularity would pop up.</p>
    <p>(Note! - Let me be clear that the word singularity is not a physical entity, but rather a malfunction of the laws of physics)</p>
    <p>Since what we are dividing on the bottom of Newton's Law of Gravitation is the distance between 2 objects, then when this distance is 0, then anything divided by zero gives you a mathematical singularity. Physicists took it a step further and proposed that these singularities might exist in real life. Maybe, if a star is heavy enough and fusion in its core does not occur at a fast-enough rate, then the star would collapse and all the matter might sit on top of each other and produce a singularity. This was the basis of black holes, and these internal inconsistencies are still found in Einstein's theory of general relativity.</p>
    <p>Einstein's Theory of General Relativity is a modern description of the mathematical frameworks governing both space and time. This theory provides a generalised description of how measurements are not absolute, but are relative depending on the observer's velocity. There will be an article on the basics of General Relativity coming soon, but for now, let's return to black holes.</p>
    <p>In 1915, Albert Einstein published his theory on general relativity, 10 years after he published his special theory of relativity. In 1916, a theoretical physicist by the name of Erik Schwarzschild became the first person to solve Einstein's equations. These Einstein Equations governed how mass and energy can warp the fabric of space and time. He discovered a singularity in this space-time, that again corresponded to the singularities found in Newton's laws. This metric which was developed eventually resembled the metric around the simplest form of a black hole. It now bears Schwarzschild's name; it is called the Schwarzschild metric. This metric describes the warping of space and time around a non-rotating, non-charged black hole. Schwarzschild also noticed that the radius of the Schwarzschild Black hole is proportional to the black hole's mass which was an interesting point. Over the decades, various other metrics, including the Kerr metric have been developed to explain rotating and charged black holes.</p>
    <p>(Note! - Metrics are mathematical equations that describe how space and time warp around massive objects.)</p>
    <p>By the late 1900's, physicist Jacob Bekenstein realised that there was a correlation between the entropy of a black hole and the surface area of a black hole. Any object that has entropy must have a surface temperature. At first, Stephen Hawking claimed that Bekenstein had made some form of mistake in his calculations, but while researching the black hole physics, Hawking also came across this bug that resembled the surface temperature of a black hole. He theorised that the vacuum or emptiness of space might not be entirely empty, but rather filled with pairs of virtual particles popping into existence and then annihilating each other after an instant. He went on to suggest that on the event horizon or edge of a black hole, one of the virtual particles might fall into the black hole, leaving the other particle without a partner to annihilate with. To preserve the conservation of energy in the universe, these particles, from our perspective, must be emitted by the black hole as radiation. In other words, we would have detected the surface temperature of a black hole. This also means that the black hole will slowly evaporate and that the surface area of the black hole is inversely proportional to the surface temperature of the black hole.</p>
    <p>This form of radiation is called Hawking Radiation, and while we haven't directly observed Hawking Radiation being emitted from black holes, we have observed it's effects using various other methods.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to 2015, when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory or LIGO fires up for the first time to detect gravitational waves for the first time. These gravitational waves would be made by dense objects, including black holes. Unfortunately, the instruments were not sensitive enough, so in 2016, LIGO was upgrade to Advanced LIGO, with approximately 1000 times more sensitivity than LIGO had a year ago and in early 2016, the first gravitational wave was discovered between two black holes and matched Einstein's predictions with pinpoint accuracy. It is surprising that we are discovering phenomena which Einstein had theorised over 100 years ago.</p>
    <p>Up till early 2019, no scientist had a real-life photo of a black hole. In fact, all photos of black holes on the internet are the impressions made by artists as to what a black hole might look like. These artists base their impressions off the physics of black holes. However, in late 2019, after months upon months of data collecting, the international team used the Event Horizon telescope to render the first real image of black hole, just to provide photographic evidence of their existence. While the shot is very fuzzy, you have to keep in mind that the black hole they were observing was millions of light years away and only a few fractions of an arcsecond across in the night sky.</p>
    <p>While we have discovered so much about black holes, there is still quite a lot of questions surrounding black holes, namely what happens inside a black hole and what happens once the observer reaches the singularity. All of these questions will be answered by future theories, and a theory of quantum gravity.</p>
