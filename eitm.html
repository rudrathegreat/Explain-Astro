Another example is that of a torch. Imagine a torch that has full batteries. As soon as one turns on the flashlight, the mass of the flashlight drops immediately. Why so? Well, prior to the toch being turned on, energy was stored inside the batteries, manifesting themselves as a part of the torch's mass. Once that energy leaves the torch as light, then you're not weighing it anymore, making the flashlight's mass drop.'s mathematical and visual elegance allows it to stick into one's mind. It elegantly connects energy, mass and the speed of light into one simple equation, very little mass can be converted to energy. Or is that the case?</p>
    <p>When Einstein wrote his paper on Mass Energy Equivalence in 1905, he actually wrote down the equation as m=E/c2. That's because, at its core, the equation is not about converting mass to energy, but rather about how we should think about mass.</p>
    <p>What Einstein is really trying to get across is that mass is a property, a property that all enerrgy exhibits, and that mass and energy are really just the same thing. How could this be possible? Well, in order to explain mass energy equivalence, it would be best if I showed some examples.</p>
    <p>A simple example would be that of two clocks. In this clock, one clock is wound up and running but the other has stopped. According to Einstein's famous equation, the clock that is  running has a greater mass. Why so? Well according to m=E/c2, the cumulative energy from the fact that the clock is running and the gears inside are spinnning manifests itself as a part of the clock's mass. Really weird, right?</p>
    <p>Another example is that of a torch. Imagine a torch that has full batteries. As soon as one turns on the flashlight, the mass of the flashlight drops immediately. Why so? Well, prior to the toch being turned on, energy was stored inside the batteries, manifesting themselves as a part of the torch's mass. Once that energy leaves the torch as light, then you're not weighing it anymore, making the flashlight's mass drop.</p>
    <p>And yes, since the Sun is a giant flashlight, then it loses billions of tonnes just by the fact that it shines. Don't worry, Earth is going to be fine, it's a very tiny fraction of the Sun's mass of its 10 billion year lifespan.</p>
    <p>So, whenever you have used a scale, you have not been measuring the amount of matter in a particular object, but rather the amount of energy in a contained system i.e. an object.</p>
